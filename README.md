# Uncertainty‑OS ▪ Kernel Demo

### Problem  
Entrepreneurship courses still use deterministic Excel toys; students underestimate tail risk and mis‑price financing terms.

### Promise  
A 30‑min browser sandbox that exposes learners to heavy‑tailed growth, macro shocks, and strategic NPC actors—with AI mentoring and telemetry for faculty.

### Non‑Goals (v0.1)  
* No multiplayer or adaptive branching  
* No LMS/LTI integration—plain HTTPS link for pilots
